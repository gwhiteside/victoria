VICTORIA
========
VICTORIA, or Videogame Investment Calculator and Tracker for Optimizing Returns on Internet Auctions, allows you to quickly and easily determine the value of any arbitrary video game lot for sale on eBay. While it's easy enough to look up one or two game prices on pricecharting.com for example, if you want to get a quick and accurate estimate of the value of a 50 game lot, that's going to be a bit of a hassle, take a lot of time, and it might not be that accurate.

VICTORIA is fast.
-----------------
Start typing the name of a game you want to price out, and it's instantly matched against the game database to give you a handy autocomplete list. Select the correct title, and VICTORIA instantly fetches the median value already stored in the local database. Add a few more games, and the prices are automatically summed for you.

VICTORIA is accurate.
---------------------
Pricewatch is great and all, but the prices can be a little off, depending on the curation and number of sales. VICTORIA allows you to set custom search strings to easily and automatically exclude spurious matches.

This program is provided as a private example only to demonstrate usage of the eBay developer API, SQL and databases, and Java UI. It is not for public usage. While it does nothing nefarious, its use probably constitutes a breach of eBay's terms of service by aggregating a small number of completed auctions for the purpose of analyzing short term price trends of a specific product. Again, do not actually use this.
